# Using Keras to Fast Track Machine Learning

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a great library used in python, built on top of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), the allows us to fast track our development of neural networks. With keras, building a neural network from scratch is as easy as 4 lines of code! 

## Using Keras

In order to use Keras, you will need the following libraries: 

* Tensorflow
* Keras (duh)
* Numpy

These libraries can all be installed using the python package manager, called [pip](Pip - Python for Beginners)

## The Example Programs

The example programs function almost identically to the ones we made by hand, however the network is built in Keras resulting in less code being wrote!
