00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Arin: Woooooo!!!
Danny: "Woah heyyy-euhh!"

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.880
Danny: Ohh, that's a sassy stance.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.680

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.520
Danny: I don't know, man.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.620

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.320
Arin:  "I have two of them.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.820

Arin: Well, too bad, man.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.440
Arin: You gotta learn to cheer better.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.760
Danny: Augh. I'm so filled with rage.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.500
"The catwalk is now finished! Pay attention; this is a big moment! The jury are about to give their verdict!"

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.080
Arin: The "jury?"
Danny: *Imitating the guy* "I can't see them! But I can see them if they stand to my left."

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.620
Arin: *Imitating Jack* "My name's Randalf."

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.980

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.660
Arin: "Not so."
Danny: I did."

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.180
Arin: *laughs*

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.480
Arin: "I *laughs* cut this curtains off."

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.100
Danny: *Imitating Eva* "I am not impressed!" *laughs*
Arin: *laughs*

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.100
*at the same time*
Danny: Oh fuck yeah I can conclude.
Arin: Oh yeah I can conclude.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.420
Danny: *laughing*

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.180
Danny: This game is very sweet.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.620
Danny: It does not talk shit on you at all.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.360
Arin: I mean, they were kinda like... "You're good but not amazing. But, whatever..."
Danny: "You have- you have room for improvement!  but... you have all the basics down!

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.080
Danny: I'm proud of you! I'm proud of you for gettin' out there."
Arin: Damn, did I just- did I just fucking decimate you on the Catwalk?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.200
Danny: Arin let me tell you something. "I-
Arin: Did I just fuckin'-  stomp on your grave, dude?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.520
Danny: I work- *laughing* w-" my grave? 
Arin: Yeahh.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.920
Danny: "I work hard for the money.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.600
Danny: ssso hard for it, honey.
Arin: *laughing*

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.260
Danny: I work hard for the money, so you better treat me right."

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.420
Arin: I still beat you on the Catwalk, though.
Danny: I will-

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.460
Arin: You can go ahead and quote music all you want, but...

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.680
Arin: I'm gonna f- I'm gonna- 18? Please.

Danny: Sorry you had to get wrapped up in this but-

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.920
Arin: It was JUST Father's Day like, give him like a week to decompress.
Danny: A- Yeah! No! That's what I'm saying.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.480
Danny: It was just Father's Day so he had his moment in the sun and now I can kill 'em.
Arin: No!

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.140
Danny: *laughing*

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.220
Arin: Don't kill my father! I take it back!

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.880
Danny: Yeah. Yeah.
Arin: I'm still f-more fabulous than you are, but-

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.860
Danny: Wow. Oh! Really? Really? You're gonna ag-add an extra dig in?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.260
Danny: Now-now I'm gonna kill your dad twice.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.980
Arin: Wha- no! He's already dead though, you can't do it twice!

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.960
Danny: Sorry, Lloyd.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.400
Danny: Have to desecrate your grave.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.440
Danny: *laughing*
Arin: Aughh, dangit.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.880
