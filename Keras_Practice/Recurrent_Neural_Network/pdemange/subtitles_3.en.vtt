00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.230
You're a professor

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.240
See that uhh beside that thing that it's holding when you press the b button

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:40.230
The Poke Helper will describe the item that is you is pointing to I hope it just says open your fucking eyes. Yeah

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.369
Some of my advisors also listed, so it should it should be pretty helpful

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.900
Now press the b button to read the description, okay, you got it

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.919
Yeah, beach ball a colorful bouncy ball. It's fun to throw it around try play catch with it

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.990
Yeah, who was quoted as saying that copernicus?

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.000
fucking, abbe

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.339
Aristotle you can't reach it for me. You can't snatch it from a defenseless creature from here

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:13.319
Guess it's a beach ball. You guess? yeah, you're a professor. I'm pretty sure we can sign this theory into law professor

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.330
He's like, "I am a professor of fun." .

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:22.319
I think throw it was written in red letters of the description. Oh my God like are we two?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.669
The Poke Helper uses red to show the words that pikachu understands now try saying throw it

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.839
over

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.839

(gurgling sounds)

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.059
So pikachu thought it was told to drop it

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.390
No, he kind of threw it. I mean that was fucking insubordination hold on you should reprimand him

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.270
Pikachu

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:57.419
I'm getting your kit. Go to the office. You know what you did

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:05.309
He liked that. Yeah? He was responding well to it. He's into the abuse bigotry was looking up in something
