# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Type of Neural Network specifically used for recongnizing images.

## Concept
Takes in an image and of a chosen scale. It uses a filter (yellow) and uses an acumulation of the filter and that will be a part of the next window called a kernal window.<br/>

This allows the Neural Network to generals the pixels to allow for corner cases.<br/>
Max Pooling helps to condense a picture to keep the neurons count down. It is similar to the concept above. A filter is used to find the largest number and puts that into the kernal window. Then the stride determines the pixels or amount it will move along the image or matrix
