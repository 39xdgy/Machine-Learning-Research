# Reconizing types of Fruit

## Dataset
Retrieved dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)

## Implementation
I used Keras' generators to grab the appropirate pictures of fruits in their respective directories and then classify by the names of the directories.

## Information
I have trained the neural network using less data to keep the time to train the CNN down.
