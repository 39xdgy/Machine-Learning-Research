## Creating Our Own Deep Neural Networks in Keras

This time, we used Keras to train our own deep neural networks to identify different datasets that we chose. In this one, we didn't follow a tutorial, but instead used the knowledge that we gained while learning the basics to build one by ourself.

## Datasets

Keras provides various datasets that can be loaded for beginners to try their hand at creating a neural network. They can be loaded like such: 

```Python

from keras.datasets import cifar10

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
```
Ozaki has used a dataset from [Keras's datasets](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification)
